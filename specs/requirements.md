# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adopting the https://agents.md/ framework in the OpenAPI MCP server project. The agents.md framework provides a standardized approach for AI agents to collaborate, document their capabilities, and maintain consistent interfaces. This adoption will enhance the project's agent-friendly architecture and improve integration with AI development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using AI agents, I want the OpenAPI MCP server to follow agents.md standards, so that agents can better understand and interact with the project structure and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is examined by an AI agent THEN the project SHALL contain an agents.md file at the root level
2. WHEN an agent reads the agents.md file THEN it SHALL understand the project's purpose, capabilities, and how to interact with it
3. WHEN the agents.md file is present THEN it SHALL follow the standard format defined by the agents.md framework

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want clear documentation of available MCP tools and their capabilities, so that I can effectively use the server's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent examines the project THEN it SHALL find comprehensive documentation of all available MCP tools
2. WHEN tool documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include input schemas, expected outputs, and usage examples
3. WHEN the documentation is updated THEN it SHALL remain synchronized with the actual tool implementations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure to be agent-friendly, so that AI assistants can navigate and understand the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN it SHALL follow agents.md conventions for directory organization
2. WHEN configuration files are present THEN they SHALL be documented in the agents.md file
3. WHEN the project has multiple entry points THEN each SHALL be clearly documented with its purpose and usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to understand the project's integration capabilities, so that I can help users configure and use the MCP server effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. integration is provided THEN it LL cover all supported services (n8n, Hosocker, geneAPI)uthentication methods are documented THEN they SHALL include all supported schemes and environment vtsconfiguration examples are provided THEN they SHALL be complete and functional

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agents.md adoption to enhance existing documentation, so that both human and AI users benefit from improved clarity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agents.md file is created THEN it SHALL complement existing README.md without duplicating content
2. WHEN documentation is restructured THEN existing functionality SHALL remain accessible
3. WHEN the adoption is complete THEN the project SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing usage patterns
