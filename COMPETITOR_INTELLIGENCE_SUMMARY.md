### 4. Automated Hook System
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **File**: `.kiro/hooks/daily-competitor-intel.kiro.hook`
- **Schedule**: Daily at 8 AM (weekdays only)
- **Safety**: Built-in rate limiting and error handling protocols

### 5. Testing and Validation
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Test Script**: `test-competitor-monitoring.js`
- **Sample Output**: Generated realistic intelligence report
- **Validation**: Confirmed workflow and data structures

## 📊 System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Scheduled Trigger** → Daily at 8 AM (Mon-Fri)
2. **Competitor Database** → Load known competitor list
3. **API Calls** → Fetch company profiles via Unipile
4. **Data Analysis** → Compare with historical data
5. **Report Generation** → Create intelligence summary
6. **Storage** → Save to `analysis/competitor-intel-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Key Components
- **MCP Server**: Unipile integration for LinkedIn data
- **Hook System**: Automated scheduling and execution
- **Safety Protocols**: Rate limiting and error handling
- **Reporting**: Structured markdown reports with insights

## 🛡️ Safety and Compliance

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum 10 searches per day
- Maximum 30 profile views per day
- 8-15 second delays between API calls
- Auto-pause on error rates > 10%

### Ethical Guidelines
- Respects LinkedIn Terms of Service
- Uses only publicly available data
- Implements proper attribution
- Focuses on competitive intelligence, not personal data
